  - cargo
    - mdbook
- GitHub
  - GitHub Pages
- hub
- git
- rsync
- VS Code
  - Extensions (listing ones I like and use, not all needed for this books)
    - docs-markdown :star: Alt-M to see help
    - Git Graph
    - GitLens
    - Rust
    - TabNine
    - Vim
- Firefox
  - Extensions
    - vimium - navigate in browser like Vim
